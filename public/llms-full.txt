# World Monitor

> Real-time global intelligence dashboard — AI-powered news aggregation, geopolitical monitoring, and infrastructure tracking in a unified situational awareness interface.

World Monitor is an open-source (AGPL-3.0) intelligence platform that aggregates 150+ news feeds, 35+ interactive map layers, and multiple AI models into a single dashboard. It runs as a web app, installable PWA, and native desktop application (Tauri) for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

A single codebase produces three specialized variants — geopolitical, technology, and finance — each with distinct feeds, panels, map layers, and branding. The tri-variant architecture uses build-time selection via the VITE_VARIANT environment variable, with runtime switching available via the header bar. Each variant tree-shakes unused data files — the finance build excludes military base coordinates and APT group data, while the geopolitical build excludes stock exchange listings.

The project is built with TypeScript, Vite, MapLibre GL JS, deck.gl, D3.js, and Tauri. All intelligence analysis (clustering, instability scoring, surge detection) runs client-side in the browser — no backend compute dependency for core intelligence. A browser-side ML pipeline (Transformers.js) provides NER and sentiment analysis without server dependency.

Language bundles are lazy-loaded on demand. Localized news feeds load region-specific RSS sources based on language preference. AI translation available for cross-language intelligence gathering.

## Tri-Variant Build System

A single codebase produces three specialized dashboards controlled by the VITE_VARIANT environment variable:

- **World Monitor** (worldmonitor.app): ~25 RSS categories, 44 panels. Focus: geopolitics, military, conflicts, infrastructure security. Unique layers: military bases, nuclear facilities, hotspots, APT groups, spaceports, critical minerals
- **Tech Monitor** (tech.worldmonitor.app): ~20 RSS categories, 31 panels. Focus: AI/ML, startups, cybersecurity, cloud. Unique layers: tech HQs, cloud regions, startup hubs, accelerators, tech events
- **Finance Monitor** (finance.worldmonitor.app): ~18 RSS categories, 30 panels. Focus: global markets, trading, central banks, Gulf FDI. Unique layers: 92 stock exchanges, 19 financial centers, 13 central banks, 10 commodity hubs, 64 Gulf FDI investments

Build-time: Vite HTML plugin transforms meta tags, Open Graph data, PWA manifest, and JSON-LD structured data. Each variant tree-shakes unused data files. Runtime: variant selector in header navigates between deployed domains (web) or sets localStorage preference (desktop).

## Architecture Principles

- **Speed over perfection**: Keyword classifier is instant; LLM refines asynchronously. Users never wait
- **Assume failure**: Per-feed circuit breakers with 5-minute cooldowns. AI fallback chain: Groq, OpenRouter, browser-side T5. Redis failures degrade gracefully. Edge functions return stale cached data when upstream APIs are down
- **Show what you can't see**: Intelligence gap tracker explicitly reports data source outages rather than silently hiding them
- **Browser-first compute**: Analysis runs client-side — no backend compute dependency for core intelligence
- **Local-first geolocation**: Country detection uses browser-side ray-casting against GeoJSON polygons (sub-millisecond, zero API dependency, works offline)
- **Multi-signal correlation**: No single data source trusted alone. Focal points require convergence across news + military + markets + protests before escalating
- **Geopolitical grounding**: Hard-coded conflict zones, baseline country risk, and strategic chokepoints prevent false alerts
- **Defense in depth**: CORS origin allowlist, domain-allowlisted RSS proxy, server-side API key isolation, token-authenticated desktop sidecar, IP rate limiting
- **Cache everything, trust nothing**: Three-tier caching (in-memory, Redis, upstream) with stale-on-error fallback
- **Baseline-aware alerting**: Rolling temporal windows against learned baselines with per-term spike multipliers and cooldowns
