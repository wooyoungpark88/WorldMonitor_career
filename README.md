### Live News & Video

- **150+ RSS feeds** across geopolitics, defense, energy, tech, and finance — domain-allowlisted proxy prevents CORS issues. Each variant loads its own curated feed set: ~25 categories for geopolitical, ~20 for tech, ~18 for finance
- **8 live video streams** — Bloomberg, Sky News, Al Jazeera, Euronews, DW, France24, CNBC, Al Arabiya — with automatic live detection that scrapes YouTube channel pages every 5 minutes to find active streams
- **Desktop embed bridge** — YouTube's IFrame API restricts playback in native webviews (error 153). The dashboard detects this and transparently routes through a cloud-hosted embed proxy with bidirectional message passing (play/pause/mute/unmute/loadVideo)
- **Idle-aware playback** — video players pause and are removed from the DOM after 5 minutes of inactivity, resuming when the user returns. Tab visibility changes also suspend/resume streams
- **Custom monitors** — Create keyword-based alerts for any topic, color-coded with persistent storage
- **Entity extraction** — Auto-links countries, leaders, organizations
- **Virtual scrolling** — news panels render only visible DOM elements, handling thousands of items without browser lag

### Signal Aggregation & Anomaly Detection

- **Multi-source signal fusion** — internet outages, military flights, naval vessels, protests, AIS disruptions, satellite fires, and keyword spikes are aggregated into a unified intelligence picture with per-country and per-region clustering
- **Temporal baseline anomaly detection** — Welford's online algorithm computes streaming mean/variance per event type, region, weekday, and month over a 90-day window. Z-score thresholds (1.5/2.0/3.0) flag deviations like "Military flights 3.2x normal for Thursday (January)" — stored in Redis via Upstash
- **Regional convergence scoring** — when multiple signal types spike in the same geographic area, the system identifies convergence zones and escalates severity

### Story Sharing & Social Export

- **Shareable intelligence stories** — generate country-level intelligence briefs with CII scores, threat counts, theater posture, and related prediction markets
- **Multi-platform export** — custom-formatted sharing for Twitter/X, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, Reddit, and Facebook with platform-appropriate formatting
- **Deep links** — every story generates a unique URL (`/story?c=<country>&t=<type>`) with dynamic Open Graph meta tags for rich social previews
- **Canvas-based image generation** — stories render as PNG images for visual sharing, with QR codes linking back to the live dashboard

### Desktop Application (Tauri)

- **Native desktop app** for macOS and Windows — packages the full dashboard with a local Node.js sidecar that runs all 60+ API handlers locally
- **OS keychain integration** — API keys stored in the system credential manager (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager), never in plaintext files
- **Token-authenticated sidecar** — a unique session token prevents other local processes from accessing the sidecar on localhost. Generated per launch using randomized hashing
- **Cloud fallback** — when a local API handler fails or is missing, requests transparently fall through to the cloud deployment (worldmonitor.app) with origin headers stripped
- **Settings window** — dedicated configuration UI (Cmd+,) for managing 17 API keys with validation, signup links, and feature-availability indicators
- **Verbose debug mode** — toggle traffic logging with persistent state across restarts. View the last 200 requests with timing, status codes, and error details
- **DevTools toggle** — Cmd+Alt+I opens the embedded web inspector for debugging

### Progressive Web App

- **Installable** — the dashboard can be installed to the home screen on mobile or as a standalone desktop app via Chrome's install prompt. Full-screen `standalone` display mode with custom theme color
- **Offline map support** — MapTiler tiles are cached using a CacheFirst strategy (up to 500 tiles, 30-day TTL), enabling map browsing without a network connection
- **Smart caching strategies** — APIs and RSS feeds use NetworkOnly (real-time data must always be fresh), while fonts (1-year TTL), images (7-day StaleWhileRevalidate), and static assets (1-year immutable) are aggressively cached
- **Auto-updating service worker** — checks for new versions every 60 minutes. Tauri desktop builds skip service worker registration entirely (uses native APIs instead)
- **Offline fallback** — a branded fallback page with retry button is served when the network is unavailable

### Additional Capabilities

- Signal intelligence with "Why It Matters" context
- Infrastructure cascade analysis with proximity correlation
- Maritime & aviation tracking with surge detection
- Prediction market integration (Polymarket) with 3-tier JA3 bypass (browser-direct → Tauri native TLS → cloud proxy)
- Service status monitoring (cloud providers, AI services)
- Shareable map state via URL parameters (view, zoom, coordinates, time range, active layers)
- Data freshness monitoring across 14 data sources with explicit intelligence gap reporting
- Per-feed circuit breakers with 5-minute cooldowns to prevent cascading failures
- Browser-side ML worker (Transformers.js) for NER and sentiment analysis without server dependency
- **Cmd+K search** — fuzzy search across 20+ result types: news headlines, countries (with direct country brief navigation), hotspots, markets, military bases, cables, pipelines, datacenters, nuclear facilities, tech companies, and more
- **Historical playback** — dashboard snapshots are stored in IndexedDB. A time slider allows rewinding to any saved state, with live updates paused during playback
- **Mobile detection** — screens below 768px receive a warning modal since the dashboard is designed for multi-panel desktop use
- **UCDP conflict classification** — countries with active wars (1,000+ battle deaths/year) receive automatic CII floor scores, preventing optimistic drift
- **HAPI humanitarian data** — UN OCHA humanitarian access metrics and displacement flows feed into country-level instability scoring with dual-perspective (origins vs. hosts) panel
- **Idle-aware resource management** — animations pause after 2 minutes of inactivity and when the tab is hidden, preventing battery drain. Video streams are destroyed from the DOM and recreated on return
- **Country-specific stock indices** — country briefs display the primary stock market index with 1-week change (S&P 500 for US, Shanghai Composite for China, etc.) via the `/api/stock-index` endpoint
- **Climate anomaly panel** — 15 conflict-prone zones monitored for temperature/precipitation deviations against 30-day ERA5 baselines, with severity classification feeding into CII
- **Country brief export** — every brief is downloadable as structured JSON, flattened CSV, or rendered PNG image, enabling offline analysis and reporting workflows
- **Print/PDF support** — country briefs include a print button that triggers the browser's native print dialog, producing clean PDF output
- **Oil & energy analytics** — WTI/Brent crude prices, US production (Mbbl/d), and inventory levels via the EIA API with weekly trend detection
- **Population exposure estimation** — WorldPop density data estimates civilian population within event-specific radii (50–100km) for conflicts, earthquakes, floods, and wildfires
- **Trending keywords panel** — real-time display of surging terms across all RSS feeds with spike severity, source count, and AI-generated context summaries
- **Download banner** — persistent notification for web users linking to native desktop installers for their detected platform
- **Download API** — `/api/download?platform={windows-exe|windows-msi|macos-arm64|macos-x64}` redirects to the matching GitHub Release asset, with fallback to the releases page
- **Non-tier country support** — clicking countries outside the 22 tier-1 list opens a brief with available data (news, markets, infrastructure) and a "Limited coverage" badge; country names for non-tier countries resolve via `Intl.DisplayNames`
- **Feature toggles** — 14 runtime toggles (AI/Groq, AI/OpenRouter, FRED economic, EIA energy, internet outages, ACLED conflicts, threat intel feeds, AIS relay, OpenSky, Finnhub, NASA FIRMS) stored in `localStorage`, allowing administrators to enable/disable data sources without rebuilding
- **AIS chokepoint detection** — the relay server monitors 8 strategic maritime chokepoints (Strait of Hormuz, Suez Canal, Malacca Strait, Bab el-Mandeb, Panama Canal, Taiwan Strait, South China Sea, Turkish Straits) and classifies transiting vessels by naval candidacy using MMSI prefixes, ship type codes, and name patterns
- **AIS density grid** — vessel positions are aggregated into 2°×2° geographic cells over 30-minute windows, producing a heatmap of maritime traffic density that feeds into convergence detection
- **Panel resizing** — drag handles on panel edges allow height adjustment (span-1 through span-4 grid rows), persisted to localStorage. Double-click resets to default height

## Regression Testing

Map overlay behavior is validated in Playwright using the map harness (`/tests/map-harness.html`).

- Cluster-state cache initialization guard:
  - `updates protest marker click payload after data refresh`
  - `initializes cluster movement cache on first protest cluster render`
- Run by variant:
  - `npm run test:e2e:full -- -g "updates protest marker click payload after data refresh|initializes cluster movement cache on first protest cluster render"`
  - `npm run test:e2e:tech -- -g "updates protest marker click payload after data refresh|initializes cluster movement cache on first protest cluster render"`

---

## How It Works

### Country Brief Pages

Clicking any country on the map opens a full-page intelligence dossier — a single-screen synthesis of all intelligence modules for that country. The brief is organized into a two-column layout:

**Left column**:

- **Instability Index** — animated SVG score ring (0–100) with four component breakdown bars (Unrest, Conflict, Security, Information), severity badge, and trend indicator
- **Intelligence Brief** — AI-generated analysis (Groq Llama 3.1) with inline citation anchors `[1]`–`[8]` that scroll to the corresponding news source when clicked
- **Top News** — 8 most relevant headlines for the country, threat-level color-coded, with source and time-ago metadata

**Right column**:

- **Active Signals** — real-time chip indicators for protests, military aircraft, naval vessels, internet outages, earthquakes, displacement flows, climate stress, conflict events, and the country's stock market index (1-week change)
- **7-Day Timeline** — D3.js-rendered event chart with 4 severity-coded lanes (protest, conflict, natural, military), interactive tooltips, and responsive resizing
- **Prediction Markets** — top 3 Polymarket contracts by volume with probability bars and external links
- **Infrastructure Exposure** — pipelines, undersea cables, datacenters, military bases, nuclear facilities, and ports within a 600km radius of the country centroid, ranked by distance

**Headline relevance filtering**: each country has an alias map (e.g., `US → ["united states", "american", "washington", "pentagon", "biden", "trump"]`). Headlines are filtered using a negative-match algorithm — if another country's alias appears earlier in the headline title than the target country's alias, the headline is excluded. This prevents cross-contamination (e.g., a headline about Venezuela mentioning "Washington sanctions" appearing in the US brief).

**Export options**: briefs are exportable as JSON (structured data with all scores, signals, and headlines), CSV (flattened tabular format), or PNG image. A print button triggers the browser's native print dialog for PDF export.

### Local-First Country Detection

Map clicks resolve to countries using a local geometry service rather than relying on network reverse-geocoding (Nominatim). The system loads a GeoJSON file containing polygon boundaries for ~200 countries and builds an indexed spatial lookup:

1. **Bounding box pre-filter** — each country's polygon(s) are wrapped in a bounding box (`[minLon, minLat, maxLon, maxLat]`). Points outside the bbox are rejected without polygon intersection testing.
2. **Ray-casting algorithm** — for points inside the bbox, a ray is cast from the point along the positive x-axis. The number of polygon edge intersections determines inside/outside status (odd = inside). Edge cases are handled: points on segment boundaries return `true`, and polygon holes are subtracted (a point inside an outer ring but also inside a hole is excluded).
3. **MultiPolygon support** — countries with non-contiguous territories (e.g., the US with Alaska and Hawaii, Indonesia with thousands of islands) use MultiPolygon geometries where each polygon is tested independently.

This approach provides sub-millisecond country detection entirely in the browser, with no network latency. The geometry data is preloaded at app startup and cached for the session. For countries not in the GeoJSON (rare), the system falls back to hardcoded rectangular bounding boxes, and finally to network reverse-geocoding as a last resort.

### Threat Classification Pipeline

Every news item passes through a two-stage classification pipeline:

1. **Keyword classifier** (instant) — pattern-matches against ~120 threat keywords organized by severity tier (critical → high → medium → low → info) and category (conflict, terrorism, cyber, disaster, etc.). Returns immediately with a confidence score.
2. **LLM classifier** (async) — fires in the background via a Vercel Edge Function calling Groq's Llama 3.1 8B at temperature 0. Results are cached in Redis (24h TTL) keyed by headline hash. When the LLM result arrives, it overrides the keyword result only if its confidence is higher.

This hybrid approach means the UI is never blocked waiting for AI — users see keyword results instantly, with LLM refinements arriving within seconds and persisting for all subsequent visitors.

### Country Instability Index (CII)

22 tier-1 countries receive continuous monitoring: US, Russia, China, Ukraine, Iran, Israel, Taiwan, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Poland, Germany, France, UK, India, Pakistan, Syria, Yemen, Myanmar, Venezuela, Brazil, and UAE. Each receives a real-time instability score (0–100) computed from:

| Component | Weight | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Baseline risk** | 40% | Pre-configured per country reflecting structural fragility |
| **Unrest events** | 20% | Protests scored logarithmically for democracies (routine protests don't trigger), linearly for authoritarian states (every protest is significant). Boosted for fatalities and internet outages |
| **Security activity** | 20% | Military flights (3pts) + vessels (5pts) from own forces + foreign military presence (doubled weight) |
| **Information velocity** | 20% | News mention frequency weighted by event severity multiplier, log-scaled for high-volume countries |

Additional boosts apply for hotspot proximity, focal point urgency, and conflict-zone floors (e.g., Ukraine is pinned at ≥55, Syria at ≥50).

### Hotspot Escalation Scoring

Intelligence hotspots receive dynamic escalation scores blending four normalized signals (0–100):

- **News activity** (35%) — article count and severity in the hotspot's area
- **Country instability** (25%) — CII score of the host country
- **Geo-convergence alerts** (25%) — spatial binning detects 3+ event types (protests + military + earthquakes) co-occurring within 1° lat/lon cells
- **Military activity** (15%) — vessel clusters and flight density near the hotspot

The system blends static baseline risk (40%) with detected events (60%) and tracks trends via linear regression on 48-hour history. Signal emissions cool down for 2 hours to prevent alert fatigue.

### Geographic Convergence Detection

Events (protests, military flights, vessels, earthquakes) are binned into 1°×1° geographic cells within a 24-hour window. When 3+ distinct event types converge in one cell, a convergence alert fires. Scoring is based on type diversity (×25pts per unique type) plus event count bonuses (×2pts). Alerts are reverse-geocoded to human-readable names using conflict zones, waterways, and hotspot databases.

### Strategic Theater Posture Assessment

Nine operational theaters are continuously assessed for military posture escalation:

| Theater | Key Trigger |
|---------|-------------|
| Iran / Persian Gulf | Carrier groups, tanker activity, AWACS |
| Taiwan Strait | PLAAF sorties, USN carrier presence |
| Baltic / Kaliningrad | Russian Western Military District flights |
| Korean Peninsula | B-52/B-1 deployments, DPRK missile activity |
| Eastern Mediterranean | Multi-national naval exercises |
| Horn of Africa | Anti-piracy patrols, drone activity |
| South China Sea | Freedom of navigation operations |
| Arctic | Long-range aviation patrols |
| Black Sea | ISR flights, naval movements |

Posture levels escalate from NORMAL → ELEVATED → CRITICAL based on a composite of:

- **Aircraft count** in theater (both resident and transient)
- **Strike capability** — the presence of tankers + AWACS + fighters together indicates strike packaging, not routine training
- **Naval presence** — carrier groups and combatant formations
- **Country instability** — high CII scores for theater-adjacent countries amplify posture

Each theater is linked to 38+ military bases, enabling automatic correlation between observed flights and known operating locations.

### Military Surge & Foreign Presence Detection

The system monitors five operational theaters (Middle East, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Western Pacific, Horn of Africa) with 38+ associated military bases. It classifies vessel clusters near hotspots by activity type:

- **Deployment** — carrier present with 5+ vessels
- **Exercise** — combatants present in formation
- **Transit** — vessels passing through

Foreign military presence is dual-credited: the operator's country is flagged for force projection, and the host location's country is flagged for foreign military threat. AIS gaps (dark ships) are flagged as potential signal discipline indicators.

### Infrastructure Cascade Modeling

Beyond proximity correlation, the system models how disruptions propagate through interconnected infrastructure. A dependency graph connects undersea cables, pipelines, ports, chokepoints, and countries with weighted edges representing capacity dependencies:

```
Disruption Event → Affected Node → Cascade Propagation (BFS, depth ≤ 3)
                                          │
                    ┌─────────────────────┤
                    ▼                     ▼
            Direct Impact         Indirect Impact
         (e.g., cable cut)    (countries served by cable)
```

**Impact calculation**: `strength = edge_weight × disruption_level × (1 − redundancy)`

Strategic chokepoint modeling captures real-world dependencies:

- **Strait of Hormuz** — 80% of Japan's oil, 70% of South Korea's, 60% of India's, 40% of China's
- **Suez Canal** — EU-Asia trade routes (Germany, Italy, UK, China)
- **Malacca Strait** — 80% of China's oil transit

Ports are weighted by type: oil/LNG terminals (0.9 — critical), container ports (0.7), naval bases (0.4 — geopolitical but less economic). This enables questions like "if the Strait of Hormuz closes, which countries face energy shortages within 30 days?"

### Related Assets & Proximity Correlation

When a news event is geo-located, the system automatically identifies critical infrastructure within a 600km radius — pipelines, undersea cables, data centers, military bases, and nuclear facilities — ranked by distance. This enables instant geopolitical context: a cable cut near a strategic chokepoint, a protest near a nuclear facility, or troop movements near a data center cluster.

### News Geo-Location

A 74-hub strategic location database infers geography from headlines via keyword matching. Hubs span capitals, conflict zones, strategic chokepoints (Strait of Hormuz, Suez Canal, Malacca Strait), and international organizations. Confidence scoring is boosted for critical-tier hubs and active conflict zones, enabling map-driven news placement without requiring explicit location metadata from RSS feeds.

### Entity Index & Cross-Referencing

A structured entity registry catalogs countries, organizations, world leaders, and military entities with multiple lookup indices:

| Index Type | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **ID index** | Direct entity lookup | `entity:us` → United States profile |
| **Alias index** | Name variant matching | "America", "USA", "United States" → same entity |
| **Keyword index** | Contextual detection | "Pentagon", "White House" → United States |
| **Sector index** | Domain grouping | "military", "energy", "tech" |
| **Type index** | Category filtering | "country", "organization", "leader" |

Entity matching uses word-boundary regex to prevent false positives (e.g., "Iran" matching "Ukraine"). Confidence scores are tiered by match quality: exact name matches score 1.0, aliases 0.85–0.95, and keyword matches 0.7. When the same entity surfaces across multiple independent data sources (news, military tracking, protest feeds, market signals), the system identifies it as a focal point and escalates its prominence in the intelligence picture.

### Temporal Baseline Anomaly Detection

Rather than relying on static thresholds, the system learns what "normal" looks like and flags deviations. Each event type (military flights, naval vessels, protests, news velocity, AIS gaps, satellite fires) is tracked per region with separate baselines for each weekday and month — because military activity patterns differ on Tuesdays vs. weekends, and January vs. July.

The algorithm uses **Welford's online method** for numerically stable streaming computation of mean and variance, stored in Redis with a 90-day rolling window. When a new observation arrives, its z-score is computed against the learned baseline. Thresholds:

| Z-Score | Severity | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| ≥ 1.5 | Low | Slightly elevated protest activity |
| ≥ 2.0 | Medium | Unusual naval presence |
| ≥ 3.0 | High/Critical | Military flights 3x above baseline |

A minimum of 10 historical samples is required before anomalies are reported, preventing false positives during the learning phase. Anomalies are ingested back into the signal aggregator, where they compound with other signals for convergence detection.

### Trending Keyword Spike Detection

Every RSS headline is tokenized into individual terms and tracked in per-term frequency maps. A 2-hour rolling window captures current activity while a 7-day baseline (refreshed hourly) establishes what "normal" looks like for each term. A spike fires when all conditions are met:

| Condition | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Absolute count** | > `minSpikeCount` (5 mentions) |
| **Relative surge** | > baseline × `spikeMultiplier` (3×) |
| **Source diversity** | ≥ 2 unique RSS feed sources |
| **Cooldown** | 30 minutes since last spike for the same term |

The tokenizer extracts CVE identifiers (`CVE-2024-xxxxx`), APT/FIN threat actor designators, and 12 compound terms for world leaders (e.g., "Xi Jinping", "Kim Jong Un") that would be lost by naive whitespace splitting. A configurable blocklist suppresses common noise terms.

Detected spikes are auto-summarized via Groq (rate-limited to 5 summaries/hour) and emitted as `keyword_spike` signals into the correlation engine, where they compound with other signal types for convergence detection. The term registry is capped at 10,000 entries with LRU eviction to bound memory usage. All thresholds (spike multiplier, min count, cooldown, blocked terms) are configurable via the Settings panel.

### Cyber Threat Intelligence Layer

Five threat intelligence feeds provide indicators of compromise (IOCs) for active command-and-control servers, malware distribution hosts, phishing campaigns, and malicious URLs:

| Feed | IOC Type | Coverage |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Feodo Tracker** (abuse.ch) | C2 servers | Botnet C&C infrastructure |
| **URLhaus** (abuse.ch) | Malware hosts | Malware distribution URLs |
| **C2IntelFeeds** | C2 servers | Community-sourced C2 indicators |
| **AlienVault OTX** | Mixed | Open threat exchange pulse IOCs |
| **AbuseIPDB** | Malicious IPs | Crowd-sourced abuse reports |

Each IP-based IOC is geo-enriched using ipinfo.io with freeipapi.com as fallback. Geolocation results are Redis-cached for 24 hours. Enrichment runs concurrently — 16 parallel lookups with a 12-second timeout, processing up to 250 IPs per collection run.

IOCs are classified into four types (`c2_server`, `malware_host`, `phishing`, `malicious_url`) with four severity levels, rendered as color-coded scatter dots on the globe. The layer uses a 10-minute cache, a 14-day rolling window, and caps display at 500 IOCs to maintain rendering performance.

### Natural Disaster Monitoring

Three independent sources are merged into a unified disaster picture, then deduplicated on a 0.1° geographic grid:

| Source | Coverage | Types | Update Frequency |
|--------|----------|-------|------------------|
| **USGS** | Global earthquakes M4.5+ | Earthquakes | 5 minutes |
| **GDACS** | UN-coordinated disaster alerts | Earthquakes, floods, cyclones, volcanoes, wildfires, droughts | Real-time |
| **NASA EONET** | Earth observation events | 13 natural event categories (30-day open events) | Real-time |

GDACS events carry color-coded alert levels (Red = critical, Orange = high) and are filtered to exclude low-severity Green alerts. EONET wildfires are filtered to events within 48 hours to prevent stale data. Earthquakes from EONET are excluded since USGS provides higher-quality seismological data.

The merged output feeds into the signal aggregator for geographic convergence detection — e.g., an earthquake near a pipeline triggers an infrastructure cascade alert.

### Dual-Source Protest Tracking

Protest data is sourced from two independent providers to reduce single-source bias:

1. **ACLED** (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data) — 30-day window, tokenized API with Redis caching (10-minute TTL). Covers protests, riots, strikes, and demonstrations with actor attribution and fatality counts.
2. **GDELT** (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone) — 7-day geospatial event feed filtered to protest keywords. Events with mention count ≥5 are included; those above 30 are marked as `validated`.

Events from both sources are **Haversine-deduplicated** on a 0.5° grid (~50km) with same-day matching. ACLED events take priority due to higher editorial confidence. Severity is classified as:

- **High** — fatalities present or riot/clash keywords
- **Medium** — standard protest/demonstration
- **Low** — default

Protest scoring is regime-aware: democratic countries use logarithmic scaling (routine protests don't trigger instability), while authoritarian states use linear scoring (every protest is significant). Fatalities and concurrent internet outages apply severity boosts.

### Climate Anomaly Detection

15 conflict-prone and disaster-prone zones are continuously monitored for temperature and precipitation anomalies using Open-Meteo ERA5 reanalysis data. A 30-day baseline is computed, and current conditions are compared against it to determine severity:

| Severity | Temperature Deviation | Precipitation Deviation |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Extreme** | > 5°C above baseline | > 80mm/day above baseline |
| **Moderate** | > 3°C above baseline | > 40mm/day above baseline |
| **Normal** | Within expected range | Within expected range |

Anomalies feed into the signal aggregator, where they amplify CII scores for affected countries (climate stress is a recognized conflict accelerant). The Climate Anomaly panel surfaces these deviations in a severity-sorted list.

### Displacement Tracking

Refugee and displacement data is sourced from the UN OCHA Humanitarian API (HAPI), providing population-level counts for refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons (IDPs). The Displacement panel offers two perspectives:

- **Origins** — countries people are fleeing from, ranked by outflow volume
- **Hosts** — countries absorbing displaced populations, ranked by intake

Crisis badges flag countries with extreme displacement: > 1 million displaced (red), > 500,000 (orange). Displacement outflow feeds into the CII as a component signal — high displacement is a lagging indicator of instability that persists even when headlines move on.

### Population Exposure Estimation

Active events (conflicts, earthquakes, floods, wildfires) are cross-referenced against WorldPop population density data to estimate the number of civilians within the impact zone. Event-specific radii reflect typical impact footprints:

| Event Type | Radius | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Conflicts** | 50 km | Direct combat zone + displacement buffer |
| **Earthquakes** | 100 km | Shaking intensity propagation |
| **Floods** | 100 km | Watershed and drainage basin extent |
| **Wildfires** | 30 km | Smoke and evacuation perimeter |

API calls to WorldPop are batched concurrently (max 10 parallel requests) to handle multiple simultaneous events without sequential bottlenecks. The Population Exposure panel displays a summary header with total affected population and a per-event breakdown table.

### Strategic Port Infrastructure

83 strategic ports are cataloged across six types, reflecting their role in global trade and military posture:

| Type | Count | Examples |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Container** | 21 | Shanghai (#1, 47M+ TEU), Singapore, Ningbo, Shenzhen |
| **Oil/LNG** | 8 | Ras Tanura (Saudi), Sabine Pass (US), Fujairah (UAE) |
| **Chokepoint** | 8 | Suez Canal, Panama Canal, Strait of Malacca |
| **Naval** | 6 | Zhanjiang, Yulin (China), Vladivostok (Russia) |
| **Mixed** | 15+ | Ports serving multiple roles (trade + military) |
| **Bulk** | 20+ | Regional commodity ports |

Ports are ranked by throughput and weighted by strategic importance in the infrastructure cascade model: oil/LNG terminals carry 0.9 criticality, container ports 0.7, and naval bases 0.4. Port proximity appears in the Country Brief infrastructure exposure section.

### Browser-Side ML Pipeline

The dashboard runs a full ML pipeline in the browser via Transformers.js, with no server dependency for core intelligence. This is automatically disabled on mobile devices to conserve memory.

| Capability | Model | Use |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| **Text embeddings** | sentence-similarity | Semantic clustering of news headlines |
| **Sequence classification** | threat-classifier | Threat severity and category detection |
| **Summarization** | T5-small | Fallback when Groq and OpenRouter are unavailable |
| **Named Entity Recognition** | NER pipeline | Country, organization, and leader extraction |

**Hybrid clustering** combines fast Jaccard similarity (n-gram overlap, threshold 0.4) with ML-refined semantic similarity (cosine similarity, threshold 0.78). Jaccard runs instantly on every refresh; semantic refinement runs when the ML worker is loaded and merges clusters that are textually different but semantically identical (e.g., "NATO expands missile shield" and "Alliance deploys new air defense systems").

News velocity is tracked per cluster — when multiple Tier 1–2 sources converge on the same story within a short window, the cluster is flagged as a breaking alert with `sourcesPerHour` as the velocity metric.

### Signal Aggregation

All real-time data sources feed into a central signal aggregator that builds a unified geospatial intelligence picture. Signals are clustered by country and region, with each signal carrying a severity (low/medium/high), geographic coordinates, and metadata. The aggregator:

1. **Clusters by country** — groups signals from diverse sources (flights, vessels, protests, fires, outages, `keyword_spike`) into per-country profiles
2. **Detects regional convergence** — identifies when multiple signal types spike in the same geographic corridor (e.g., military flights + protests + satellite fires in Eastern Mediterranean)
3. **Feeds downstream analysis** — the CII, hotspot escalation, focal point detection, and AI insights modules all consume the aggregated signal picture rather than raw data

### Data Freshness & Intelligence Gaps

A singleton tracker monitors 22 data sources (GDELT, RSS, AIS, military flights, earthquakes, weather, outages, ACLED, Polymarket, economic indicators, NASA FIRMS, cyber threat feeds, trending keywords, oil/energy, population exposure, and more) with status categorization: fresh (<15 min), stale (1h), very_stale (6h), no_data, error, disabled. It explicitly reports **intelligence gaps** — what analysts can't see — preventing false confidence when critical data sources are down or degraded.

### Prediction Markets as Leading Indicators

Polymarket geopolitical markets are queried using tag-based filters (Ukraine, Iran, China, Taiwan, etc.) with 5-minute caching. Market probability shifts are correlated with news volume: if a prediction market moves significantly before matching news arrives, this is flagged as a potential early-warning signal.

**Cloudflare JA3 bypass** — Polymarket's API is protected by Cloudflare TLS fingerprinting (JA3) that blocks all server-side requests. The system uses a 3-tier fallback:

| Tier | Method | When It Works |
|------|--------|---------------|
| **1** | Browser-direct fetch | Always (browser TLS passes Cloudflare) |
| **2** | Tauri native TLS (reqwest) | Desktop app (Rust TLS fingerprint differs from Node.js) |
| **3** | Vercel edge proxy | Rarely (edge runtime sometimes passes) |

Once browser-direct succeeds, the system caches this state and skips fallback tiers on subsequent requests. Country-specific markets are fetched by mapping countries to Polymarket tags with name-variant matching (e.g., "Russia" matches titles containing "Russian", "Moscow", "Kremlin", "Putin").

Markets are filtered to exclude sports and entertainment (100+ exclusion keywords), require meaningful price divergence from 50% or volume above $50K, and are ranked by trading volume. Each variant gets different tag sets — geopolitical focus queries politics/world/ukraine/middle-east tags, while tech focus queries ai/crypto/business tags.

### Macro Signal Analysis (Market Radar)

The Market Radar panel computes a composite BUY/CASH verdict from 7 independent signals sourced entirely from free APIs (Yahoo Finance, mempool.space, alternative.me):

| Signal | Computation | Bullish When |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Liquidity** | JPY/USD 30-day rate of change | ROC > -2% (no yen squeeze) |
| **Flow Structure** | BTC 5-day return vs QQQ 5-day return | Gap < 5% (aligned) |
| **Macro Regime** | QQQ 20-day ROC vs XLP 20-day ROC | QQQ outperforming (risk-on) |
| **Technical Trend** | BTC vs SMA50 + 30-day VWAP | Above both (bullish) |
| **Hash Rate** | Bitcoin mining hashrate 30-day change | Growing > 3% |
| **Mining Cost** | BTC price vs hashrate-implied cost | Price > $60K (profitable) |
| **Fear & Greed** | alternative.me sentiment index | Value > 50 |

The overall verdict requires ≥57% of known signals to be bullish (BUY), otherwise CASH. Signals with unknown data are excluded from the denominator.

**VWAP Calculation** — Volume-Weighted Average Price is computed from aligned price/volume pairs over a 30-day window. Pairs where either price or volume is null are excluded together to prevent index misalignment:

```
VWAP = Σ(price × volume) / Σ(volume)    for last 30 trading days
```

The **Mayer Multiple** (BTC price / SMA200) provides a long-term valuation context — historically, values above 2.4 indicate overheating, while values below 0.8 suggest deep undervaluation.

### Gulf FDI Investment Database

The Finance variant includes a curated database of 64 major foreign direct investments by Saudi Arabia and the UAE in global critical infrastructure. Investments are tracked across 12 sectors:

| Sector | Examples |
|--------|---------|
| **Ports** | DP World's 11 global container terminals, AD Ports (Khalifa, Al-Sokhna, Karachi), Saudi Mawani ports |
| **Energy** | ADNOC Ruwais LNG (9.6 mtpa), Aramco's Motiva Port Arthur refinery (630K bpd), ACWA Power renewables |
| **Manufacturing** | Mubadala's GlobalFoundries (82% stake, 3rd-largest chip foundry), Borealis (75%), SABIC (70%) |
| **Renewables** | Masdar wind/solar (UK Hornsea, Zarafshan 500MW, Gulf of Suez), NEOM Green Hydrogen (world's largest) |
| **Megaprojects** | NEOM THE LINE ($500B), Saudi National Cloud ($6B hyperscale datacenters) |
| **Telecoms** | STC's 9.9% stake in Telefónica, PIF's 20% of Telecom Italia NetCo |

Each investment records the investing entity (DP World, Mubadala, PIF, ADNOC, Masdar, Saudi Aramco, ACWA Power, etc.), target country, geographic coordinates, investment amount (USD), ownership stake, operational status, and year. The Investments Panel provides filterable views by country (SA/UAE), sector, entity, and status — clicking any row navigates the map to the investment location.

On the globe, investments appear as scaled bubbles: ≥$50B projects (NEOM) render at maximum size, while sub-$1B investments use smaller markers. Color encodes status: green for operational, amber for under-construction, blue for announced.

### Stablecoin Peg Monitoring

Five major stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI, FDUSD, USDe) are monitored via the CoinGecko API with 2-minute caching. Each coin's deviation from the $1.00 peg determines its health status:

| Deviation | Status | Indicator |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| ≤ 0.5% | ON PEG | Green |
| 0.5% – 1.0% | SLIGHT DEPEG | Yellow |
| > 1.0% | DEPEGGED | Red |

The panel aggregates total stablecoin market cap, 24h volume, and an overall health status (HEALTHY / CAUTION / WARNING). The `coins` query parameter accepts a comma-separated list of CoinGecko IDs, validated against a `[a-z0-9-]+` regex to prevent injection.

### Oil & Energy Analytics

The Oil & Energy panel tracks four key indicators from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) API:

| Indicator | Series | Update Cadence |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **WTI Crude** | Spot price ($/bbl) | Weekly |
| **Brent Crude** | Spot price ($/bbl) | Weekly |
| **US Production** | Crude oil output (Mbbl/d) | Weekly |
| **US Inventory** | Commercial crude stocks | Weekly |

Trend detection flags week-over-week changes exceeding ±0.5% as rising or falling, with flat readings within the threshold shown as stable. Results are cached client-side for 30 minutes. The panel provides energy market context for geopolitical analysis — price spikes often correlate with supply disruptions in monitored conflict zones and chokepoint closures.

### BTC ETF Flow Estimation

Ten spot Bitcoin ETFs are tracked via Yahoo Finance's 5-day chart API (IBIT, FBTC, ARKB, BITB, GBTC, HODL, BRRR, EZBC, BTCO, BTCW). Since ETF flow data requires expensive terminal subscriptions, the system estimates flow direction from publicly available signals:

- **Price change** — daily close vs. previous close determines direction
- **Volume ratio** — current volume / trailing average volume measures conviction
- **Flow magnitude** — `volume × price × direction × 0.1` provides a rough dollar estimate

This is an approximation, not a substitute for official flow data, but it captures the direction and relative magnitude correctly. Results are cached for 15 minutes.

## Tri-Variant Architecture

A single codebase produces three specialized dashboards, each with distinct feeds, panels, map layers, and branding:

| Aspect | World Monitor | Tech Monitor | Finance Monitor |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Domain** | worldmonitor.app | tech.worldmonitor.app | finance.worldmonitor.app |
| **Focus** | Geopolitics, military, conflicts | AI/ML, startups, cybersecurity | Markets, trading, central banks |
| **RSS Feeds** | ~25 categories (politics, MENA, Africa, think tanks) | ~20 categories (AI, VC blogs, startups, GitHub) | ~18 categories (forex, bonds, commodities, IPOs) |
| **Panels** | 44 (strategic posture, CII, cascade) | 31 (AI labs, unicorns, accelerators) | 30 (forex, bonds, derivatives, institutional) |
| **Unique Map Layers** | Military bases, nuclear facilities, hotspots | Tech HQs, cloud regions, startup hubs | Stock exchanges, central banks, Gulf investments |
| **Desktop App** | World Monitor.app / .exe | Tech Monitor.app / .exe | Finance Monitor.app / .exe |

**Build-time selection** — the `VITE_VARIANT` environment variable controls which configuration is bundled. A Vite HTML plugin transforms meta tags, Open Graph data, PWA manifest, and JSON-LD structured data at build time. Each variant tree-shakes unused data files — the finance build excludes military base coordinates and APT group data, while the geopolitical build excludes stock exchange listings.

**Runtime switching** — a variant selector in the header bar (🌍 WORLD | 💻 TECH | 📈 FINANCE) navigates between deployed domains on the web, or sets `localStorage['worldmonitor-variant']` in the desktop app to switch without rebuilding.

---

## Architecture Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Speed over perfection** | Keyword classifier is instant; LLM refines asynchronously. Users never wait. |
| **Assume failure** | Per-feed circuit breakers with 5-minute cooldowns. AI fallback chain: Groq → OpenRouter → browser-side T5. Redis cache failures degrade gracefully. Every edge function returns stale cached data when upstream APIs are down. |
| **Show what you can't see** | Intelligence gap tracker explicitly reports data source outages rather than silently hiding them. |
| **Browser-first compute** | Analysis (clustering, instability scoring, surge detection) runs client-side — no backend compute dependency for core intelligence. |
| **Local-first geolocation** | Country detection uses browser-side ray-casting against GeoJSON polygons rather than network reverse-geocoding. Sub-millisecond response, zero API dependency, works offline. Network geocoding is a fallback, not the primary path. |
| **Multi-signal correlation** | No single data source is trusted alone. Focal points require convergence across news + military + markets + protests before escalating to critical. |
| **Geopolitical grounding** | Hard-coded conflict zones, baseline country risk, and strategic chokepoints prevent statistical noise from generating false alerts in low-data regions. |
| **Defense in depth** | CORS origin allowlist, domain-allowlisted RSS proxy, server-side API key isolation, token-authenticated desktop sidecar, input sanitization with output encoding, IP rate limiting on AI endpoints. |
| **Cache everything, trust nothing** | Three-tier caching (in-memory → Redis → upstream) with versioned cache keys and stale-on-error fallback. Every API response includes `X-Cache` header for debugging. CDN layer (`s-maxage`) absorbs repeated requests before they reach edge functions. |
| **Bandwidth efficiency** | Gzip compression on all relay responses (80% reduction). Content-hash static assets with 1-year immutable cache. Staggered polling intervals prevent synchronized API storms. Animations and polling pause on hidden tabs. |
| **Baseline-aware alerting** | Trending keyword detection uses rolling 2-hour windows against 7-day baselines with per-term spike multipliers, cooldowns, and source diversity requirements — surfacing genuine surges while suppressing noise. |
| **Run anywhere** | Same codebase produces three specialized variants (geopolitical, tech, finance) and deploys to Vercel (web), Railway (relay), Tauri (desktop), and PWA (installable). Desktop sidecar mirrors all cloud API handlers locally. Service worker caches map tiles for offline use while keeping intelligence data always-fresh (NetworkOnly). |

---

## Source Credibility & Feed Tiering

Every RSS feed is assigned a source tier reflecting editorial reliability:

| Tier | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Tier 1** | Wire services, official government sources | Reuters, AP, BBC, DOD |
| **Tier 2** | Major established outlets | CNN, NYT, The Guardian, Al Jazeera |
| **Tier 3** | Specialized/niche outlets | Defense One, Breaking Defense, The War Zone |
| **Tier 4** | Aggregators and blogs | Google News, individual analyst blogs |

Feeds also carry a **propaganda risk rating** and **state affiliation flag**. State-affiliated sources (RT, Xinhua, IRNA) are included for completeness but visually tagged so analysts can factor in editorial bias. Threat classification confidence is weighted by source tier — a Tier 1 breaking alert carries more weight than a Tier 4 blog post in the focal point detection algorithm.

---

## Edge Function Architecture

World Monitor uses 60+ Vercel Edge Functions as a lightweight API layer. Each edge function handles a single data source concern — proxying, caching, or transforming external APIs. This architecture avoids a monolithic backend while keeping API keys server-side:

- **RSS Proxy** — domain-allowlisted proxy for 100+ feeds, preventing CORS issues and hiding origin servers. Feeds from domains that block Vercel IPs are automatically routed through the Railway relay.
- **AI Pipeline** — Groq and OpenRouter edge functions with Redis deduplication, so identical headlines across concurrent users only trigger one LLM call. The classify-event endpoint pauses its queue on 500 errors to avoid wasting API quota.
- **Data Adapters** — GDELT, ACLED, OpenSky, USGS, NASA FIRMS, FRED, Yahoo Finance, CoinGecko, mempool.space, and others each have dedicated edge functions that normalize responses into consistent schemas
- **Market Intelligence** — macro signals, ETF flows, and stablecoin monitors compute derived analytics server-side (VWAP, SMA, peg deviation, flow estimates) and cache results in Redis
- **Temporal Baseline** — Welford's algorithm state is persisted in Redis across requests, building statistical baselines without a traditional database
- **Custom Scrapers** — sources without RSS feeds (FwdStart, GitHub Trending, tech events) are scraped and transformed into RSS-compatible formats
- **Finance Geo Data** — stock exchanges (92), financial centers (19), central banks (13), and commodity hubs (10) are served as static typed datasets with market caps, GFCI rankings, trading hours, and commodity specializations

All edge functions include circuit breaker logic and return cached stale data when upstream APIs are unavailable, ensuring the dashboard never shows blank panels.

---

## Multi-Platform Architecture

All three variants run on three platforms that work together:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Vercel (Edge)              │
│  60+ edge functions · static SPA   │
│  CORS allowlist · Redis cache       │
│  AI pipeline · market analytics     │
│  CDN caching (s-maxage) · PWA host  │
└──────────┬─────────────┬────────────┘
           │             │ fallback
           │             ▼
           │  ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
           │  │     Tauri Desktop (Rust + Node)    │
           │  │  OS keychain · Token-auth sidecar  │
           │  │  60+ local API handlers · gzip     │
           │  │  Cloud fallback · Traffic logging   │
           │  └───────────────────────────────────┘
           │
           │ https:// (server-side)
           │ wss://   (client-side)
           ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│       Railway (Relay Server)        │
│  WebSocket relay · OpenSky OAuth2   │
│  RSS proxy for blocked domains      │
│  AIS vessel stream · gzip all resp  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why two platforms?** Several upstream APIs (OpenSky Network, CNN RSS, UN News, CISA, IAEA) actively block requests from Vercel's IP ranges. The Railway relay server acts as an alternate origin, handling:

- **AIS vessel tracking** — maintains a persistent WebSocket connection to AISStream.io and multiplexes it to all connected browser clients, avoiding per-user connection limits
- **OpenSky aircraft data** — authenticates via OAuth2 client credentials flow (Vercel IPs get 403'd by OpenSky without auth tokens)
- **RSS feeds** — proxies feeds from domains that block Vercel IPs, with a separate domain allowlist for security

The Vercel edge functions connect to Railway via `WS_RELAY_URL` (server-side, HTTPS) while browser clients connect via `VITE_WS_RELAY_URL` (client-side, WSS). This separation keeps the relay URL configurable per deployment without leaking server-side configuration to the browser.

All Railway relay responses are gzip-compressed (zlib `gzipSync`) when the client accepts it and the payload exceeds 1KB, reducing egress by ~80% for JSON and XML responses.

---

## Desktop Application Architecture

The Tauri desktop app wraps the dashboard in a native window with a local Node.js sidecar that runs all API handlers without cloud dependency:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Tauri (Rust)                        │
│  Window management · OS keychain · Menu bar      │
│  Token generation · Log management               │
│  Polymarket native TLS bridge                    │
└─────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                      │ spawn + env vars
                      ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Node.js Sidecar (port 46123)            │
│  60+ API handlers · Gzip compression            │
│  Cloud fallback · Traffic logging                │
│  Verbose debug mode · Circuit breakers           │
└─────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                      │ fetch (on local failure)
                      ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Cloud (worldmonitor.app)                 │
│  Transparent fallback when local handlers fail   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Secret Management

API keys are stored in the operating system's credential manager (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager) — never in plaintext config files. At sidecar launch, all 17 supported secrets are read from the keyring, trimmed, and injected as environment variables. Empty or whitespace-only values are skipped.

Secrets can also be updated at runtime without restarting the sidecar: saving a key in the Settings window triggers a `POST /api/local-env-update` call that hot-patches `process.env` and clears the module cache so handlers pick up the new value immediately.

### Sidecar Authentication

A unique 32-character hex token is generated per app launch using randomized hash state (`RandomState` from Rust's standard library). The token is:

1. Injected into the sidecar as `LOCAL_API_TOKEN`
2. Retrieved by the frontend via the `get_local_api_token` Tauri command (lazy-loaded on first API request)
3. Attached as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to every local request

The `/api/service-status` health check endpoint is exempt from token validation to support monitoring tools.

### Cloud Fallback

When a local API handler is missing, throws an error, or returns a 5xx status, the sidecar transparently proxies the request to the cloud deployment. Endpoints that fail are marked as `cloudPreferred` — subsequent requests skip the local handler and go directly to the cloud until the sidecar is restarted. Origin and Referer headers are stripped before proxying to maintain server-to-server parity.

### Observability

- **Traffic log** — a ring buffer of the last 200 requests with method, path, status, and duration (ms), accessible via `GET /api/local-traffic-log`
- **Verbose mode** — togglable via `POST /api/local-debug-toggle`, persists across sidecar restarts in `verbose-mode.json`
- **Dual log files** — `desktop.log` captures Rust-side events (startup, secret injection counts, menu actions), while `local-api.log` captures Node.js stdout/stderr
- **DevTools** — `Cmd+Alt+I` toggles the embedded web inspector

---

## Bandwidth Optimization

The system minimizes egress costs through layered caching and compression across all three deployment targets:

### Vercel CDN Headers

Every API edge function includes `Cache-Control` headers that enable Vercel's CDN to serve cached responses without hitting the origin:

| Data Type | `s-maxage` | `stale-while-revalidate` | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|-----------|
| Classification results | 3600s (1h) | 600s (10min) | Headlines don't reclassify often |
| Country intelligence | 3600s (1h) | 600s (10min) | Briefs change slowly |
| Risk scores | 300s (5min) | 60s (1min) | Near real-time, low latency |
| Market data | 3600s (1h) | 600s (10min) | Intraday granularity sufficient |
| Fire detection | 600s (10min) | 120s (2min) | VIIRS updates every ~12 hours |
| Economic indicators | 3600s (1h) | 600s (10min) | Monthly/quarterly releases |

Static assets use content-hash filenames with 1-year immutable cache headers. The service worker file (`sw.js`) is never cached (`max-age=0, must-revalidate`) to ensure update detection.

### Railway Relay Compression

All relay server responses pass through `gzipSync` when the client accepts gzip and the payload exceeds 1KB. This applies to OpenSky aircraft JSON, RSS XML feeds, UCDP event data, AIS snapshots, and health checks — reducing wire size by approximately 80%.

### Frontend Polling Intervals

Panels refresh at staggered intervals to avoid synchronized API storms:

| Panel | Interval | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| AIS maritime snapshot | 10s | Real-time vessel positions |
| Service status | 60s | Health check cadence |
| Market signals / ETF / Stablecoins | 180s (3min) | Market hours granularity |
| Risk scores / Theater posture | 300s (5min) | Composite scores change slowly |

All animations and polling pause when the tab is hidden or after 2 minutes of inactivity, preventing wasted requests from background tabs.

## Caching Architecture

Every external API call passes through a three-tier cache with stale-on-error fallback:

```
Request → [1] In-Memory Cache → [2] Redis (Upstash) → [3] Upstream API
                                                              │
            ◄──── stale data served on error ────────────────┘
```

| Tier | Scope | TTL | Purpose |
|------|-------|-----|---------|
| **In-memory** | Per edge function instance | Varies (60s–900s) | Eliminates Redis round-trips for hot paths |
| **Redis (Upstash)** | Cross-user, cross-instance | Varies (120s–900s) | Deduplicates API calls across all visitors |
| **Upstream** | Source of truth | N/A | External API (Yahoo Finance, CoinGecko, etc.) |

Cache keys are versioned (`opensky:v2:lamin=...`, `macro-signals:v2:default`) so schema changes don't serve stale formats. Every response includes an `X-Cache` header (`HIT`, `REDIS-HIT`, `MISS`, `REDIS-STALE`, `REDIS-ERROR-FALLBACK`) for debugging.

The AI summarization pipeline adds content-based deduplication: headlines are hashed and checked against Redis before calling Groq, so the same breaking news viewed by 1,000 concurrent users triggers exactly one LLM call.

---

## Security Model

| Layer | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **CORS origin allowlist** | Only `worldmonitor.app`, `tech.worldmonitor.app`, `finance.worldmonitor.app`, and `localhost:*` can call API endpoints. All others receive 403. Implemented in `api/_cors.js`. |
| **RSS domain allowlist** | The RSS proxy only fetches from explicitly listed domains (~90+). Requests for unlisted domains are rejected with 403. |
| **Railway domain allowlist** | The Railway relay has a separate, smaller domain allowlist for feeds that need the alternate origin. |
| **API key isolation** | All API keys live server-side in Vercel environment variables. The browser never sees Groq, OpenRouter, ACLED, Finnhub, or other credentials. |
| **Input sanitization** | User-facing content passes through `escapeHtml()` (prevents XSS) and `sanitizeUrl()` (blocks `javascript:` and `data:` URIs). URLs use `escapeAttr()` for attribute context encoding. |
| **Query parameter validation** | API endpoints validate input formats (e.g., stablecoin coin IDs must match `[a-z0-9-]+`, bounding box params are numeric). |
| **IP rate limiting** | AI endpoints use Upstash Redis-backed rate limiting to prevent abuse of Groq/OpenRouter quotas. |
| **Desktop sidecar auth** | The local API sidecar requires a per-session `Bearer` token generated at launch. The token is stored in Rust state and injected into the sidecar environment — only the Tauri frontend can retrieve it via IPC. Health check endpoints are exempt. |
| **OS keychain storage** | Desktop API keys are stored in the operating system's credential manager (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager), never in plaintext files or environment variables on disk. |
| **No debug endpoints** | The `api/debug-env.js` endpoint returns 404 in production — it exists only as a disabled placeholder. |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and run
git clone https://github.com/koala73/worldmonitor.git
cd worldmonitor
npm install
vercel dev       # Runs frontend + all 60+ API edge functions
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

> **Note**: `vercel dev` requires the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) (`npm i -g vercel`). If you use `npm run dev` instead, only the frontend starts — news feeds and API-dependent panels won't load. See [Self-Hosting](#self-hosting) for details.

### Environment Variables (Optional)

The dashboard works without any API keys — panels for unconfigured services simply won't appear. For full functionality, copy the example file and fill in the keys you need:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

The `.env.example` file documents every variable with descriptions and registration links, organized by deployment target (Vercel vs Railway). Key groups:

| Group | Variables | Free Tier |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **AI** | `GROQ_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | 14,400 req/day (Groq), 50/day (OpenRouter) |
| **Cache** | `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | 10K commands/day |
| **Markets** | `FINNHUB_API_KEY`, `FRED_API_KEY`, `EIA_API_KEY` | All free tier |
| **Tracking** | `WINGBITS_API_KEY`, `AISSTREAM_API_KEY` | Free |
| **Geopolitical** | `ACLED_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `NASA_FIRMS_API_KEY` | Free for researchers |
| **Relay** | `WS_RELAY_URL`, `VITE_WS_RELAY_URL`, `OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` | Self-hosted |
| **UI** | `VITE_VARIANT`, `VITE_MAP_INTERACTION_MODE` (`flat` or `3d`, default `3d`) | N/A |

See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for the complete list with registration links.

## Self-Hosting

World Monitor relies on **60+ Vercel Edge Functions** in the `api/` directory for RSS proxying, data caching, and API key isolation. Running `npm run dev` alone starts only the Vite frontend — the edge functions won't execute, and most panels (news feeds, markets, AI summaries) will be empty.

### Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

The simplest path — Vercel runs the edge functions natively on their free tier:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel          # Follow prompts to link/create project
```

Add your API keys in the Vercel dashboard under **Settings → Environment Variables**, then visit your deployment URL. The free Hobby plan supports all 60+ edge functions.

### Option 2: Local Development with Vercel CLI

To run everything locally (frontend + edge functions):

```bash
npm install -g vercel
cp .env.example .env.local   # Add your API keys
vercel dev                    # Starts on http://localhost:3000
```

> **Important**: Use `vercel dev` instead of `npm run dev`. The Vercel CLI emulates the edge runtime locally so all `api/` endpoints work. Plain `npm run dev` only starts Vite and the API layer won't be available.

### Option 3: Static Frontend Only

If you only want the map and client-side features (no news feeds, no AI, no market data):

```bash
npm run dev    # Vite dev server on http://localhost:5173
```

This runs the frontend without the API layer. Panels that require server-side proxying will show "No data available". The interactive map, static data layers (bases, cables, pipelines), and browser-side ML models still work.

### Platform Notes

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Vercel** | Full support | Recommended deployment target |
| **Linux x86_64** | Works with `vercel dev` | Full local development |
| **macOS** | Works with `vercel dev` | Full local development |
| **Raspberry Pi / ARM** | Partial | `vercel dev` edge runtime emulation may not work on ARM. Use Option 1 (deploy to Vercel) or Option 3 (static frontend) instead |
| **Docker** | Planned | See [Roadmap](#roadmap) |

### Railway Relay (Optional)

For live AIS vessel tracking and OpenSky aircraft data, deploy the WebSocket relay on Railway:

```bash
# On Railway, deploy with:
node scripts/ais-relay.cjs
```

Set `WS_RELAY_URL` (server-side, HTTPS) and `VITE_WS_RELAY_URL` (client-side, WSS) in your environment. Without the relay, AIS and OpenSky layers won't show live data, but all other features work normally.
